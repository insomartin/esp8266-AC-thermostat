# esp8266-AC-thermostat
this project is a simple implementation of a ordinary thermostat controlled by esp8266/esp32. <br>
- hts221 temperature and humidity sensor. <br>
- 4 relays for compressor, fan high, fan mid and fan low. <br>
- the code is a good starting point for implementing wifi based control for standard compressor AC's <br>
